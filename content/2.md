## 1. Introduction to Audio Codecs
- What an audio codec is and its role in digital audio systems.  
- Difference between lossy and lossless codecs.  
- Overview of common codecs (MP3, AAC, Opus, FLAC, etc.).  

## 2. How Audio Codecs Work
- Core principles: sampling, quantization, and compression.  
- Encoding and decoding pipeline.  
- Psychoacoustic models and bit rate control.  

## 3. Applications and Use Cases
- Streaming platforms, telecommunication, and real-time communication.  
- Audio storage, broadcasting, and embedded systems.  
- Use in AI audio systems (e.g., speech synthesis, neural codecs).  

## 4. Challenges and Future Directions
- Trade-offs between quality, latency, and efficiency.  
- Emerging neural codecs (e.g., EnCodec, SoundStream, Mimi).  
- Future of adaptive and AI-driven audio compression.
