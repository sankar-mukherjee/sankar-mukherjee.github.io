title: Model Compression
---

## 1. Introduction to Model Compression
- What model compression is and why it’s important.  
- The need for efficient models in edge and real-time applications.  
- Overview of trade-offs between accuracy, size, and speed.  

## 2. Core Techniques
- **Pruning:** Removing redundant weights or neurons.  
- **Quantization:** Reducing numerical precision (e.g., FP32 → INT8/4).  
- **Knowledge Distillation:** Transferring knowledge from large to small models.  
- **Low-Rank and Sparse Representations:** Efficient parameterization methods.  

## 3. Applications and Use Cases
- Deployment on mobile, IoT, and embedded devices.  
- Real-time inference for speech, vision, and NLP tasks.  
- Cloud cost reduction and energy-efficient AI systems.  

## 4. Challenges and Future Directions
- Maintaining accuracy after compression.  
- Hardware-aware compression and co-design.  
- Future trends: dynamic sparsity, adaptive quantization, and post-training optimization.
